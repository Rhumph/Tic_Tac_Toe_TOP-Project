# Tic_Tac_Toe_TOP-Project

In this project I will make a Tic Tac Toe game (AKA Naughts and Crosses in Australia).

I am attempting to maximise encapsulation of my code and use clusores/modules.

My plan will be.

1. Plan out the best way to make the game logic work
2. Generate working JS that successfully works in the console
3. Attach the working logic to DOM elements and make a full game
